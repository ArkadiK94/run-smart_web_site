# run-smart_web_site

Project that I did due to a Udemy Course that I took. The name of the course "WEB-разработчик 2021"

Technologies that we used:
1. Scss - to orgenazie css files
2. gulp - to automate many tasks
3. animate.style library - for animations
4. wow.js library - to control when the animetion will happen
5. imask.js - to make phone mask
6. js
7. css
8. html

In Scss/Css we used some important features:
1. @media - for making the site responsive for other devices
2. @keyframes - for making an animation
3. @mixin - unique to css preprocessors , for not coping blocks of code several times 
4. $varibales - unique to css preprocessors , for not coping varibales several times 
5. flex - for pacing the elements in the right place
